            "answer": "Electrolytes, vitamins, and ionic trace minerals are bitter by nature. That‚Äôs why traditional sports drinks and hydration supplements use sugar and sweeteners to offset their intense taste.\n<br><br>\nFinding the balance between effective, clean ingredients and a neutral flavor profile took our team of scientists two years to get right. With a proper dosage in a full drink, you should notice little to no taste."
