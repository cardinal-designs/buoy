And the reason why is simple ‚Äî you pee a lot more.\n\nElectrolytes are important at any point in life, but they have some specific roles in pregnancy. All nutrition is provided through the placenta during pregnancy, which is high in sodium and low in potassium. The amniotic fluid electrolytes are tightly regulated, and in the third trimester, potassium is accumulated in the fetal tissues while sodium is delivered in amniotic fluid. This balance of electrolytes, and how they shift, is vital to healthy development.\n\nSodium is also important for its role in transferring water between cells and its balance with potassium. When sodium is high, potassium is low, and vice versa. Because sodium is believed to be a factor in developing preeclampsia, a significant pregnancy complication, maintaining the ideal electrolyte balance is crucial."
