            "location": "New Jersey, USA",
            "fast_fact": "Based on studies of the potential roles of Vitamin A in reversing tumor development and boosting immune function, it has been suggested that Vitamin A might help reduce cancer risk.",
            "important": "Vitamin A is known as an anti-inflammatory vitamin and has regulatory roles in cellular immune responses and humoral immune processes. It's crucial to a mechanism that occurs in the digestive system and leads to immune tolerance across the entire gut lining which is the crutch of good health. The gut is where many people first lose immune tolerance.\n\nVitamin A has exhibited a therapeutic effect in the treatment of various infectious diseases."

            "important": "Vitamin E is a primary defense factor preventing oxidative damage and protecting cell membranes. \n\nAs a powerful antioxidant, it helps cells fight off infection by neutralizing harmful free radicals - molecules that can damage cells and may contribute to chronic diseases. \n\nWhen consumed with Vitamin C, studies show Vitamin D3 further reduces oxidative stress."
