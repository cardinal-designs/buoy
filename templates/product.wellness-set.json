It's crucial to a mechanism that occurs in the digestive system and leads to immune tolerance across the entire gut lining which is the crutch of good health. The gut is where many people first lose immune tolerance.\n\nVitamin A has exhibited a therapeutic effect in the treatment of various infectious diseases."
